# Stemming
This folder focuses on our experiment on stemming. To read about the whole process visit the [experiment](https://pragmalingu.de/docs/experiments/experiment1) on our website. For less a detailed but more analysed article look at our [comparison](https://pragmalingu.de/docs/comparisons/stemming).

## Experiment
This folder contains the methods and the finished notebook to run the experiment.

* First Experiment
To run the whole experiment on Elasticsearch use this notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/01_Stemming/Experiment/First_Experiment_Stemming.ipynb)

* Algorithmic Stemmers
Our notebook on algortihmic stemmers shows you how to use them in ELasticsearch [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/01_Stemming/Experiment/Algorithmic_Stemmer.ipynb)

* Dictionary Stemmers
Our notebook on dictionary stemmers shows you how to use them in ELasticsearch [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/01_Stemming/Experiment/Hunspell_Dictionary_Stemmer.ipynb)

## Evaluation
To only evaluate the methods using our Elasticsearch instance use this notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/01_Stemming/Evaluation/Comparison_Stemming_vs_Standard_Search.ipynb)
