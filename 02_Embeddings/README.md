# Embeddings

This branch focuses on our experiment on embeddings with BERT. To read about the whole process visit the [experiment on our website](https://pragmalingu.de/docs/experiments/experiment2). For a less detailed but more analysed article look at [our comparison](https://pragmalingu.de/docs/comparisons/embeddings).

## Experiment

This folder contains the methods and the finished notebook to run the experiment.

* Second Experiment to run the whole experiment on Elasticsearch use this notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/01_Stemming/Experiment/Second_Experiment_BERT_Embeddings.ipynb)

* Our notebook with a demonstration of how the BERT embeddings work [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pragmalingu/experiments/blob/master/02_Embeddings/Experiment/BERT_Embeddings_example.ipynb)

## Evaluation
